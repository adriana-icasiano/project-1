## Project Outline
Explore US and Europe e-scooter businesses to understand the correlations between rate of injuries, city demographic, lawsuits, regulations (helmets and age limit) and popularity. Using existing and accessible data on e-scooters, we would like to understand the pros and cons of e-scooters in order to form an educated opinion on whether e-scooters should be banned or expanded and the types of regulations that should be recommended.

## Our Questions

Faced with the rapid growth of e-scooters, local governments from Europe and US are faced with important regulatory questions. Local government responses to the above pros and cons vary from banning to piloting e-scooter programs to expansion. Many developed new regulations to cope with the problems.

Should e-scooters be banned or expanded? <br>
What is the demographic of cities where e-scooters are currently used? <br>
What is the average distance and time traveled via e-scooters?<br>
What are the injuries related to e-scooters? <br>
What type of regulations alleviate the problems?<br>
What can e-scooter rental/ sellers do to alleviate the problems?<br>

## Workflow
(to add picture)

## Data
### APIs
>Gmaps
>[NABSA (
North American Bike Share Association)  - GBFS (General Bikeshare Feed Specification)](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) - Real-time e-scooters availability status by operators for certain cities.

>Census demographic data

### Queries

>[Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) - NEISS (National Electronic Injuries Surveillance System) Query](https://www.cpsc.gov/cgibin/NEISSQuery/UserCriteria.aspx?UserAff=5x08cgz9T6YPDAZJzvlZjA%3d%3d&UserAffOther=9OYR9kUytIsLilKZieD5xg%3d%3d) - Injuries related to e-scooters are available for query from this official website. 

>[National Household Travel Survey](https://nhts.ornl.gov/)

## Data Exploration
Use Google to search for a “Lime API”
Found a github account for NABSA ( North American Bike Share Association) - GBFS (General Bikeshare Feed Specification) 
Obtained a csv file with a list of API addresses for certain cities
Retrieved for geocodes for available e-scooters

We also created a layered markers to understand the geographical distribution of each operator using the sample codes from gmaps. From here we exported the gmaps to a html so that we can view the gmaps figure externally if we wanted to.

## Data Analysis

### Demographics
#### Population 
Data Source: Census.gov<br>
#### Age
Data Source: Census.gov<br>

#### Mean Walk Minutes to Work
Data Source: Census.gov<br>
Of 50 randomly sampled counties*, the mean walking minutes to work for each county varies from 0.1 minute to 9.7 minute, with an exception of one county (23.5 minute).<br>

#### Income per Capita
Data Source: Census.gov<br>
For the same 50 counties*, the Income Per Capita by County varies between $7,887 to $44,683. Similar to other public transport system, it is priced at a affordable rate and serves a broad population.<br>

#### Trip Duration
Data Source: National Household Travel Survey<br>
The graph provides the time and distance traveled by bike, walk, and segway/e-scooters, and indicates that the time the use of e-scooters is lowest.E-scooters are use for short trips and intermediary transport to groceries, and train station.

## Findings
### The use of scooters resembles the use of public transportation for short distance and local travels based on:
>1) Demographics of cities that use e-scooters differ from the rest of the US.
>2) Average distance traveled ~5 miles
>3) Average Time Duration ~20 mins.
>4) Mean walking minutes to work between 0.1 to 10 minutes.
>5) Income per capita varies
### Injuries are preventable with proper regulations.
### Percentage of women user is lower than men users due to safety concerns.
### What can government and companies do to address safety issues?
#### Injuries
>1) Limit riding on scooter/bike lanes
>2) Set curfew 
>3) Set age limit
>4) Require helmets
>5) Prevent riders from drinking and riding
>6) Display warning about injuries
#### Gender gap in usage of e-scooter
> Companies should focus on a safer design for women to ensure safety

## Conclusion
With productive and thoughtful government regulations, the pros of e-scooter use outweigh the cons.
