# project-1
## Project Outline
Explore US and Europe e-scooter businesses to understand the correlations between rate of injuries, city demographic, lawsuits, regulations (helmets and age limit) and popularity. Using existing and accessible data on e-scooters, we would like to understand the pros and cons of e-scooters in order to form an educated opinion on whether e-scooters should be banned or expanded and the types of regulations that should be recommended.

## Background
(to add heatmaps and map with operators and with info box)

## Hypothesis 1
> Null Hypothesis: Income per capita does not impact the popularity of e-scooters.

> Alternative Hypothesis: The popularity of e-scooters depends on income per capita. The higher the income per capita the higher the popularity.

## Hypothesis 2
> Null Hypothesis: The number of minutes spent walking to work does not impact the popularity of e-scooters.

> Alternative Hypothesis: E-scooters are popular for a range of minutes spent walking to work.

The graph provides the time and distance traveled by bike, walk, and segway/e-scooters, and indicates that the time the use of e-scooters is lowest.E-scooters are use for short trips and intermediary transport to groceries, and train station.

## Hypothesis 3
> Null Hypothesis: The use of e-scooters does not reduces pollution.

> Alternative Hypothesis: The use of e-scooters reduces pollution.

## Hypothesis 4
> Null Hypothesis: The use of drug and alcohol does not increase the rate of injuries.

> Alternative Hypothsis: The use of drug and alcohol increases the rate of injuries.

Based on the injuries under influence pie chart which shows that about 10.3% of injuries are associated with drug and alcohol use. Of the 10.3%
