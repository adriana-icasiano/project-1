# project-1
## Project Outline
Explore US e-scooter businesses to understand the correlations between rate of injuries, city demographic, lawsuits, regulations (helmets and age limit) and popularity. Using data on places where e-scooter are already banned, we would like to understand what cities are ideal places to ban e-scooter, and where they could find additional businesses.
