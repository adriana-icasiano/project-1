## Project Outline
Explore US and Europe e-scooter businesses to understand the correlations between rate of injuries, city demographic, lawsuits, regulations (helmets and age limit) and popularity. Using existing and accessible data on e-scooters, we would like to understand the pros and cons of e-scooters in order to form an educated opinion on whether e-scooters should be banned or expanded and the types of regulations that should be recommended.


## Background
(to add heatmaps and map with operators and with info box)

## Hypothesis 1
Null Hypothesis: Income per capita does not impact the popularity of e-scooters.
Alternative Hypothesis: The popularity of e-scooters depends on income per capita. The higher the income per capita the higher the popularity. 

## Hypothesis 2
Null Hypothesis: The number of minutes spent walking to work does not impact the popularity of e-scooters.
Alternative Hypothesis: E-scooters are popular for a range of minutes spent walking to work.

## Hypothesis 3
Null Hypothesis: The use of e-scooters does not reduces pollution.
Alternative Hypothesis: The use of e-scooters reduces pollution.

## Hypothesis 4
Null Hypothesis: The use of drug and alcohol does not increase the rate of injuries.
Alternative Hypothsis: The use of drug and alcohol increases the rate of injuries.

Based on the injuries under influence pie chart which shows that about 10.3% of injuries are associated with drug and alcohol use. Of the 10.3%
